1. Download the UFO Dataset as a text file: http://sisbid.github.io/Module1/data/ufo/ufo_data_complete.txt and read in the text file as a new R object. Confirm the number of rows is the same as the CSV-based object

2. Rename columns to ensure they have no spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. 

3. Use the [`lubridate` package](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) to change the class of the `$datetime` column to the date class.

4. Capitalize the states in the `$state` column

5. Coerce the longitude and lattitude columns to the `numeric` class

6. Write out this updated `data.frame` as a new CSV file

7. Download the Excel-formatted UFO Dataset: http://sisbid.github.io/Module1/data/ufo/ufo_data_complete.xlsx and import the dataset as a new R object. Confirm it has the same number of lines as the CSV- and Tab-delimited-based R objects
